# Echidna configuration for the CommitReveal harness.
#
# The harness exercises the commit/reveal flow and maintains an invariant
# ensuring that the internal nonce accounting never drifts from the number
# of successful reveals. The fuzzing campaign is configured in assertion
# mode so that Echidna stops immediately on counterexamples.
testMode: assertion
corpusDir: echidna/corpus/commit-reveal
seed: 1

# Force crytic-compile to use the bundled solc compiler so the Echidna
# container does not require Foundry's `forge` binary.
cryticArgs:
  - --compile-force-framework
  - solc
