# Deployment Addresses

For end-to-end production deployment steps see [deployment-production-guide.md](deployment-production-guide.md).

This file is generated by `scripts/deploy.ts` and will be overwritten with
the latest module addresses after running:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network <network>
```

Deployments are anchored to the `$AGIALPHA` token at
`0xA61a3B3a130a9c20768EEBF97E21515A6046a1fA`, exported from
[`scripts/constants.ts`](../scripts/constants.ts) and cannot be overridden.
