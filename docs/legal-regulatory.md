$AGI is strictly a utility token. It is minted only when AGI Nodes contribute computational resources and is used to acquire products and services within the network. Holding $AGI tokens does not constitute an investment, and they confer no ownership, voting rights, or entitlement to profits. For full disclosures, see [AGIJobManagerv0.sol](../legacy/AGIJobManagerv0.sol).

For tax treatment of jobs executed through the protocol, see [tax-obligations.md](tax-obligations.md). The platform and its owner never collect fees or handle user funds and therefore remain taxâ€‘neutral across jurisdictions.
