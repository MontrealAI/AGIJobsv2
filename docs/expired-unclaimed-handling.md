# Expired stakes and unclaimed fees

The platform never takes custody of idle funds. Expired stakes or unclaimed rewards remain taxâ€‘neutral for the operator.

## Stakes

- Stakes remain withdrawable by the original participant.
- Governance may slash and redistribute expired stakes to active validators or a DAO treasury.
- Any burn of slashed tokens must be performed by the DAO from its own wallet.

## Fees

- Fees accumulate in `FeePool` under individual beneficiary balances.
- Unclaimed balances may be left untouched, claimed later or redirected to a governance treasury.
- The platform itself never recognizes these tokens as income.
