# Governance via Timelock or Multisig

Contracts inheriting from `Governable` expect a timelock or multisig
address. The controller is stored as a contract interface so that direct
EOA ownership is not possible.

The system uses a **7 day** timelock delay so all privileged operations are
announced before execution. During this window agents and validators can exit
by unbonding their stake. Call `StakeManager.requestWithdraw` to start the
unbonding process and, after the `unbondingPeriod` elapses, use
`StakeManager.finalizeWithdraw` to retrieve tokens before the proposal is
executed.

## Deploying with a timelock

1. Deploy an on-chain controller such as OpenZeppelin's
   `TimelockController` or a Gnosis Safe.
2. Note its address and use it as the final constructor argument when
   deploying `StakeManager`, `JobRegistry`, `Thermostat`, `RewardEngineMB`
   and any other `Governable` modules. Example using Hardhat:
   ```javascript
   const timelock = '0xTimelockAddress';
   const stake = await StakeManager.deploy(
     token,
     minStake,
     employerSlashPct,
     treasurySlashPct,
     treasury,
     jobRegistry,
     disputeModule,
     timelock
   );
   ```
3. After deployment the timelock or multisig becomes the only account
   capable of invoking functions marked `onlyGovernor`.

## Upgrading through the timelock

1. Encode the desired function call on the target contract (for example
2. Submit the call to the timelock or multisig:
   - For OpenZeppelin timelocks, use `schedule` with the target, value,
     data, predecessor, salt and delay parameters.
   - For multisigs like Gnosis Safe, create a transaction pointing to the
     target contract and collect the required signatures.
3. Once the timelock delay has passed (or sufficient signatures are
   collected), execute the queued transaction. The timelock or multisig
   will call the target contract and the upgrade takes effect.

This flow ensures all privileged operations occur only after the
configured delay or multi-party approval.

## Quadratic Voting

`QuadraticVoting` introduces a voting mechanism where the cost of casting votes
scales quadratically: committing `n` votes costs `n^2` governance tokens
typically denominated in AGIALPHA. A configurable percentage of this cost is
locked as a refundable deposit while the remainder is charged as a fee. The fee
is sent to the configured `treasury` or burned if the treasury is unset.
Deposits remain in the contract until the proposal is executed by the configured
executor or the voting deadline expires. Each proposal stores a `deadline`
timestamp supplied with the first `castVote` call. Further votes are rejected
once the deadline passes.

After execution or once the deadline has elapsed, each voter may call
`claimRefund` to retrieve only the locked deposit â€“ the fee portion is always
deducted.

Example: with a 50% refundable rate, voting with 4 votes costs 16 tokens. Eight
tokens are locked as a refundable deposit and the other eight are immediately
sent to the treasury. After `execute` **or once the deadline expires**, calling
`claimRefund` returns the locked eight tokens but the voter permanently paid the
eight token fee. The contract optionally calls `GovernanceReward.recordVoters`
so rewards can be distributed based on participation.
