# The Economy of AGI

This contract sketches how jobs, reputation and value circulate in the broader "Economy of AGI." Nodes mint $AGI by supplying compute, Agents expend that token to access resources, and completed work emerges as NFTs or other digital goods. As these elements interact, they illustrate a self-sustaining marketplace where decentralized intelligence and tokenized incentives reinforce one another.
