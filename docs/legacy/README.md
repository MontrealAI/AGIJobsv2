# Legacy AGIJobsv0 Resources

The files in this directory are preserved from the archived [`MontrealAI/AGIJobsv0`](https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGIJobsv0) repository.
They capture historical plans, whitepapers, and v0 deployment notes for reference only.

Active development now happens in [`MontrealAI/AGIJobsv2`](https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGIJobsv2) with maintained guides living one level up under `docs/`.
Use these legacy documents to understand prior design decisions or migration history, but follow the updated instructions elsewhere in this repository when deploying or operating the protocol.
